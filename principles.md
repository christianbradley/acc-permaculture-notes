# Permaculture Principles 

Observe and Interact
--------------------

* take time to engage with nature
* be patient and observe before you start work
* be informed and know the cycles of the place
* know the flows


Catch and Store Energy
----------------------

"By developing systems that collect resources when they are abundant
we can use them in times of need"

### Energy Cycling

Try to utilize any resource seven times before allowing 
it to leave.

## Obtain A Yield

"Everything Gardens"

Ensure that you are getting truly useful rewards as
part of the work that you are doing.

## Apply Self Regulation and Accept Feedback

Create *resilient* systems.

"We need to discourage inappropriate activity
to ensure that systems can continue to function well."

"The sins of the fathers are visited on the children
of the seventh generation."

### Appropriate Technology:

An appropriate technology may be:

* Low cost 
* Durable
* Life enhancing
* Producing net energy
* Safe in production
* Can be used and disposed of safely

Examples:

* Pickaxe
* Hammer
* Planting a tree

### Inappropriate technology

Inappropriate technologies may be:

* High cost
* Consuming more energy than is worth it
* Unsafe

Energy Efficient Planning
-------------------------

"Use and value renewable resources and services"

Using Permaculture "zones" is an example of energy 
efficient planning.

### Stacking and Packing

Use vertical space, and plant densely.
Do not use "rows" for planting, these were made for
machines. 

## Produce No Waste

How does this relate to zones (wasted effort).

Composting, etc...

## Design from Patterns to Details

"By stepping back we can observe patterns in nature and 
society. These can form the backbone of our designs, 
with the details filled in as we go."

Branching, streamlines, meanders, star, spiral, diamond, 
wave, fractal.

How can we use these patterns in our designs?

### Using Patterns in Nature

Succession: Plant with the recognition that certain elements
prepare the way for the system to support other elements in
the future. Consider time as an element in design.

## Integrate Rather than Segregate

Putting the right things in the right place, relationships
develop...

### Redundancy

* Each function is supported by many elements
* Example: water can come from a faucet, creek, pond, well
* Pollution is an unused resource

## Each Element Serves Many Functions, work towards every element serving three functions

Example: Permaculture chicken 

## Use Small and Slow Solutions

Small and slow systems are easier to maintain, making better use
of local resources and produce more sustainable outcomes.

20 square feet per person is enough room to grow all the vegetables 
someone can eat.

The bigger the project, the more work needed.

### Stocking

* Find balance of various elements so that one does not overpower
the other.

* Resilience the capability of a strained body to recover
the size and shape after deformation caused especially by
compressive stess.

## Use and Value Diversity

Diversity reduces vulnerability to a variety of threats and takes
andvantage of the unique nature of the environment in which it
resides.

## Use Edges & Value the Marginal

The interface between things is where the most interesting events
take place, these are often the most valuable diverse and 
productive elements in the system.

* Increase edge to increase diversity *

Increase with:
* windbreaks
* mulch traps
* curves
* small scale projects
* ponds 
* wetlands 
* water

Decrease with: 
* straight lines

## Creatively use and respond to change

We can have a positive impact on inevitable change
by carefully observing and then intervening at the right time.

* Work where it counts
* Work with nature
* Everything has an effect on the environment
* Everything has an intrensic worth
* Pollution is an unused resource
* A successful design creates a self managed system
* Let nature do the work
